        <H2>Founders / Collaborators</H2>
        <p>It all started when three intelligent individuals that branched off from one 
            family tree decided to put their talents to work. These three individuals
            are no other than; Tehroy Coleman known as "Ace G", Elroy Coleman,
            the big bad producer known as "Mag 17" and a young creative individual, Tafaroy Coleman
            known as "AceGad".These three individuals came together and founded something so wonderful and legendary. 
             Anyways, this team consists of a very versatile and talent embedded
            artist, a producer that has the ears for music making every song he produces
            have the quality to deliver it to you all, and finally, the very creative
            individual, the person behind all the vibrant cover art for the different songs
            released.

            Anyone that is a fan of Ace G knows that every verse, chorus, and every song
            that he has ever released is known to be a hit leaving a ring in everyones ears,
            having them jumping and vibing to his songs.
